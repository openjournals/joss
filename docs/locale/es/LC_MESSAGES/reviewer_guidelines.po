"Firstly, thank you so much for agreeing to review for the Journal of Open"
" Source Software (JOSS), we're delighted to have your help. This document"
" is designed to outline our editorial guidelines and help you understand "
"our requirements for accepting a submission into the JOSS. Our review "
"process is based on a tried-and-tested approach of the [rOpenSci "
"collaboration](http://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)."

"We like to think of JOSS as a 'developer friendly' journal. That is, if "
"the submitting authors have followed best practices (have documentation, "
"tests, continuous integration, and a license) then their review should be"
" rapid."

"For those submissions that don't quite meet the bar, please try to give "
"clear feedback on how authors could improve their submission. A key goal "
"of JOSS is to raise the quality of research software generally and you "
"(the experienced reviewer) are well placed to give this feedback."

"A JOSS review involves checking submissions against a checklist of "
"essential software features and details in the submitted paper. This "
"should be objective, not subjective; it should be based on the materials "
"in the submission as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, "
"prejudices, or interpretations."

"The definition of a conflict of Interest in peer review is a circumstance"
" that makes you \"unable to make an impartial scientific judgment or "
"evaluation.\" ([PNAS Conflict of Interest "
"Policy](http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/coi.xhtml)). JOSS is concerned "
"with avoiding any actual conflicts of interest, and being sufficiently "
"transparent that we avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest as "
"well."

"As a reviewer (or editor), COIs are your present or previous association "
"with any authors of a submission: recent (past four years) collaborators "
"in funded research or work that is published; and lifetime for the family"
" members, business partners, and thesis student/advisor or mentor. In "
"addition, your recent (past year) association with the same organization "
"of a submitter is a COI, for example, being employed at the same "
"institution."

"If you have a conflict of interest with a submission, you should disclose"
" the specific reason to the submissions' editor (or to an EiC if you are "
"an editor, or to the other EiCs if you are an EiC). This may lead to you "
"not being able to review or edit the submission, but some conflicts may "
"be recorded and then waived, and if you think you are able to make an "
"impartial assessment of the work, you should request that the conflict be"
" waived. For example, if you and a submitter were two of 2000 authors of "
"a high energy physics paper but did not actually collaborate. Or if you "
"and a submitter worked together 6 years ago, but due to delays in the "
"publishing industry, a paper from that collaboration with both of you as "
"authors was published 2 years ago. Or if you and a submitter are both "
"employed by the same very large organization but in different units "
"without any knowledge of each other."
