        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>Although spaces may feel informal at times, we want to remind authors and reviewers (and anyone else) that this is a professional space. As such, the <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> community adheres to a code of conduct adapted from the <%= link_to "Contributor Covenant", "http://contributor-covenant.org", :target => "_blank" %> code of conduct.</p>

        <p>Authors and reviewers will be required to confirm they have read our <%= link_to "code of conduct", "https://github.com/#{ setting(:github) }/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md", :target => "_blank" %>, and are expected to adhere to it in all <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> spaces and associated interactions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="main" id="ethics">
        <h1>Ethics</h1>

        <p>We also want to remind authors and reviewers (and anyone else) that we expect and require ethical behavior. Some examples are:
          <ul>
            <li>All authors are obliged to provide retractions or corrections of any mistakes of which they become aware.</li>
            <li>Plagiarism (e.g., violation of another author's copyright), for both software and papers, is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Self-plagiarism (repeated publication of the same work) is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Author lists must be correct and complete. All listed authors must have made a contribution to the work, and all significant contributors should be included in the author list.</li>
            <li>Reviews should be accurate and non-fraudulent. Examples of concerns are: Authors should not suggest reviewers who are not real people or have conflicts. Reviewers and editors must disclose conflicts. Bribes for authors, reviewers, editors are not permitted.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Any potentially unethical behavior should be brought to the attention of the JOSS staff.
           See <a href="#contacts">Contacting JOSS</a>.
           The JOSS Editors will track any concerns and respond to the submitter with a resolution, which will range from doing nothing if the editors disagree about the issue to withdrawing papers and notifying authors' institutions.

          <h1>Cost and Sustainability Model</h1>
          <p><%= setting(:name) %> is an open access journal <em>committed to running at minimal costs, with zero publication fees (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_processing_charge">article processing charges</a>) or subscription fees</em>.</p>
          <p>Under the NumFOCUS nonprofit umbrella as part of <a href="http://www.theoj.org">Open Journals</a>, <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> is eligible to seek grants for sustaining its future. With an entirely volunteer team, <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> is seeking to sustain its operations via donations and grants, keeping its low cost of operation and free service for authors.</p>

          <p>In the spirit of transparency, below is an outline of our current running costs:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Annual Crossref <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/20pub_fees.html">membership</a>: $275 / year</li>
            <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> paper DOIs: $1 / accepted paper</li>
            <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> website hosting (Heroku): $19 / month</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Assuming a publication rate of 200 papers per year this works out at ~$3.50 per paper ((19*12) + 200 + 275) / 200 .</p>
