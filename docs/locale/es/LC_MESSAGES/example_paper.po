"Note that the paper begins by a metadata section (the enclosing --- lines"
" are mandatory) and ends with a References heading, and the references "
"are built automatically from the content in the `.bib` file. You should "
"enter in-text citations in the paper body following correct [Markdown "
"citation syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-citations).  "
"Also note that the references include full names of venues, e.g., "
"journals and conferences, not abbreviations only understood in the "
"context of a specific discipline."
