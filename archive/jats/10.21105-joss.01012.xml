  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>R is a language designed for the processing of (numerical) data,
  and images are just numerical data. The original motivation for
  developing imager was that existing image processing facilities in R
  were at the time rather limited, and that R had the potential to be a
  great environment for processing image data. Many scientists now use R
  as their primary computing environment, and some amount of image
  processing is a requirement in fields like biology (when microscopy is
  used), or astronomy.</p>
  <p>Because R already provides a lot of generic data processing tools,
  <italic>imager</italic> was designed to be “idiomatic”, so that native
  R tools could be used easily on image data. On the other hand, because
  R is also slow, and ill-adapted to many image processing algorithms
  that involve looping over each pixel in an image,
  <italic>imager</italic> was designed to provide easy access to a C++
  image processing library as a fall-back option (using Rcpp
  (<xref alt="Eddelbuettel et al., 2011" rid="ref-rcpp" ref-type="bibr">Eddelbuettel
  et al., 2011</xref>) as glue).</p>
  <p>There are many C++ libraries for image processing, and among them
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</ext-link>
  is arguably dominant. However, its API is quite complex and targets
  computer vision rather than image processing <italic>per se</italic>.
  A popular alternative is the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cimg.eu">CImg</ext-link>
  library developed by the second author
  (<xref alt="Tschumperlé, 2012" rid="ref-CImg" ref-type="bibr">Tschumperlé,
  2012</xref>). <italic>CImg</italic> provides an elegant API, and is
  easy to learn. In addition, <italic>CImg</italic> is fast, parallel
  (using OpenMP), and supports image data in up to four dimensions,
  meaning that it can process hyperspectral or video data. It is already
  used in many OSS applications
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cimg.eu/links.shtml">partial
  list here</ext-link>. Notably, <italic>CImg</italic> is the back-end
  for
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gmic.eu/">G’MIC</ext-link>,
  a popular command-line tool and Gimp/Krita plugin for image
  processing.</p>
  <p><italic>imager</italic> is based on <italic>CImg</italic> but is
  not a simple wrapper. It is organised around two main types of
  objects: raster images (with <italic>cimg</italic> type), and pixel
  sets (with <italic>pixset</italic> type). The first are meant to
  represent images, while the second represent regions of interest, such
  as foreground pixels, cells, etc. Both come with standard R generics,
  like print, plot, or as.data.frame. Internally, they are nothing more
  than 4D arrays, of numeric or logical type, that CImg can directly
  work with.</p>
  <p><italic>imager</italic> provides all classical image processing
  operations (filtering, morphology, etc.), along with more advanced
  functionality. It integrates well with packages from the tidyverse
  such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purrr.tidyverse.org/">purrr</ext-link>.
  It is extensively documented, with two vignettes
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/vignettes/gettingstarted.html">getting
  started</ext-link>, and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/vignettes/pixsets.html">pixsets</ext-link>),
  and many worked-out examples on the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dahtah.github.io/imager/">website</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="current-status-and-plans-for-the-future">
  <title>Current status, and plans for the future</title>
  <p>The package is now relatively mature (over 3 years old). As a
  testament to its usefulness, we note that <italic>imager</italic> is
  used by several other OSS projects: as of Aug. 2018, 18 dependencies
  are listed on
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/index.html">CRAN</ext-link>.
  The package contains at this stage far more functions than its author
  can remember, so the current focus for development is on enhancing
  documentation and “discoverability” of imager’s content, and
  consistency of the API. Another interesting area is support for
  missing values: this is generally a strong point of R, and a weak
  point of image processing libraries. <italic>imager</italic> provides
  limited support for missing values, but future versions should
  increase the level of support.</p>
