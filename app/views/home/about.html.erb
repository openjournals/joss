        <h1>Scope & submission requirements</h1>

        <p>Not all software is eligible to be published in JOSS.</p>

        <p>JOSS publishes articles about research software. This definition includes software that: solves complex modeling problems in a scientific context (physics, mathematics, biology, medicine, social science, neuroscience, engineering); supports the functioning of research instruments or the execution of research experiments; extracts knowledge from large data sets; offers a mathematical library; or similar.</p>

        <p>JOSS submissions must:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Be open source (i.e., have an <%= link_to "OSI-approved license", "https://opensource.org/licenses/category", :target => "_blank" %>).</li>
          <li>Have an obvious research application.</li>
          <li>Be feature-complete (no half-baked solutions) and be designed for maintainable extension (not one-off modifications).</li>
          <li>Minor 'utility' packages, including 'thin' API clients, and single-function packages are not acceptable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Authors wishing to make a pre-submission enquiry should <%= link_to "open an issue", "https://github.com/#{Rails.application.settings["github"]}/issues/new?title=Pre-submission%20enquiry"%> on the <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> repository.</p>

        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>Although spaces may feel informal at times, we want to remind authors and reviewers (and anyone else) that
          this is a professional space. As such, the <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> community adheres to a code of
          conduct adapted from the
          <%= link_to "Contributor Covenant", "http://contributor-covenant.org", target: "_blank" %> code of conduct.
        </p>

        <p>Authors and reviewers will be required to confirm they have read our
          <%= link_to "code of conduct", "https://github.com/#{ setting(:github) }/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md", target: "_blank" %>,
          and are expected to adhere to it in all <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> spaces and associated interactions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="generic-content-item" id="ethics">
        <h1>Ethics Guidelines</h1>
        <p>We also want to remind authors and reviewers (and anyone else) that we expect and require ethical behavior. Some examples are:
          <ul>
            <li>All authors are obliged to provide retractions or corrections of any mistakes of which they become aware.</li>
            <li>Plagiarism (e.g., violation of another author's copyright), for both software and papers, is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Self-plagiarism (repeated publication of the same work) is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Author lists must be correct and complete. All listed authors must have made a contribution to the work, and all significant contributors should be included in the author list.</li>
            <li>Reviews should be accurate and non-fraudulent. Examples of concerns are: Authors should not suggest reviewers who are not real people or have conflicts (see <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html#joss-conflict-of-interest-policy" target="_blank">conflict of interest policy</a> for details). Reviewers and editors must disclose conflicts. Bribes for authors, reviewers, editors are not permitted.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <b>Allegations of misconduct</b>
        <p>Allegations of research misconduct associated with a <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> submission (either during review, or post-publication) are handled by the Open Journals ethics team. Reports should be sent privately to <%= mail_to "admin@theoj.org", "our editorial team" %> at which point the report will be triaged by the Open Journals ethics officer to determine the nature and severity of the case. Options available to the Open Journals ethics officer range from recommending no action to instigating a full investigation by the Open Journals ethics team which may result in researchers' institutions and funders being notified and the <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> being retracted.</p>

        <p>Although <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> is not yet a member of <%= link_to "COPE", "https://publicationethics.org" %> (application pending), our processes are modeled on the <%= link_to "COPE guideline procedures for ethics complaints", "https://publicationethics.org/files/publication-ethics-editorial-office-cope-flowchart.pdf" %>.</p>

        <b>Complaints process</b>
        <p>Complaints about the conduct or decision making of the <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> editorial team can be sent to the <%= mail_to "admin@theoj.org", "Open Journals governance team" %>.</p>

        <h2 id="ethics-and-malpractice"><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement</h2>
        <b>Editorial Board</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> editorial board's members are recognized experts in the field. The full names and affiliations of the members are provided on the journalâ€™s website (see <a href="<%= setting(:url) %>/about#editorial_board">editorial board</a>). The individual editors' contact information are provided on that site, via their GitHub pages, and general contact information for the editorial office also on the <a href="<%= setting(:url) %>/about#contact">journalâ€™s website</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Authors and Authors responsibilities</b>
        <ul>
          <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> does not charge any fees for manuscript processing and/or publishing materials, as is stated on the <a href="<%= setting(:url) %>/about#costs">journal's website</a>.</li>

          <li>Authors are obliged to participate in peer review process, as described in <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#the-review-process">submission guidelines</a>.</li>

          <li>All authors have significantly contributed to the research. The submitting author is required to be a <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#submission-requirements">major contributor to the software</a> they are submitting and the review process includes a check that <em><a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html#authorship">â€˜the full list of paper authors seems appropriate and complete?â€™</a></em>.</li>

          <li>All authors are obliged to provide retractions or corrections of mistakes (see <a href="<%= setting(:url) %>/about#ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#what-should-my-paper-contain">what should my paper contain?</a>).</li>

          <li>Forbidden to publish same research in more than one journal (see <a href="<%= setting(:url) %>/about#ethics">ethics</a>).</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Peer-review process</b>
        <ul>
          <li>All of <%= setting(:abbreviation) %>'s content is subjected to peer-review (see <a href="http://joss.theoj.org/about">about</a> and <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">docs</a>).</li>

          <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> peer-review is defined as obtaining advice on individual manuscripts from reviewers <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing.html#finding-reviewers">expert in the field</a>. This advice is public, and is given to both the editor(s) and the author(s), with the aim of pointing out issues the reviewers believe are <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html#guiding-principles">insufficiently addressed for publication</a>.</li>

          <li>The <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> review process is clearly described on the <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html">journalâ€™s website</a>.</li>

          <li>Judgments should be <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html#guiding-principles">objective</a>.</li>

          <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> reviewers should ideally have no conflict of interest. In practice, this is not always possible. If a reviewer has a conflict of interest, it must be declared and recorded, and the editors may <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html#joss-conflict-of-interest-policy">choose to waive</a> it if this is in the best interest of the review process.</li>

          <li>Reviewers should point out <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html#an-important-note-about-novel-software-and-citations-of-relevant-work">relevant published work</a> which is not yet cited.</li>

          <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> reviews are public and non-anonymous while in progress and post-review, as they take place via GitHub issues in a public repository.</li>

          <li>Self-plagiarism (repeated publication of the same work) is not allowed.</li>

          <li>Reviews should be accurate and non-fraudulent. Examples of concerns are: Authors should not suggest reviewers who are not real people or have conflicts. Reviewers and editors must disclose conflicts. Bribes for authors, reviewers, editors are not permitted.</li>
          <li>Minor fixes are processed by the Editors in Chief (EiCs), and are publicly handled based on requests from the original authors (managed in the GitHub review linked from the paper).</li>
          <li>Major corrections will be reviewed by the EiC and ethics team. If accepted, the paper will be re-published with an editorial note on the GitHub review (linked from the paper page).</li>
          <li>Retractions: EiC team and the ethics team review. If we deem that a retraction is warranted, we will update the paper and leave a retraction notice (<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/c44313ada36f12eebbaff10eb0888071">see an example retraction for the linked paper</a>)</li>
          </ul>

        <b>Copyright and Access</b>

        </ul>

        <b>Ownership and management</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Information about the ownership and/or management of a journal is clearly indicated on the journalâ€™s website (see <a href="http://www.theoj.org">http://www.theoj.org</a>).</li>
          <li>JOSS and the <a href="http://www.theoj.org">Open Journals</a> do not use organizational names that would mislead potential authors and editors about the nature of the journalâ€™s owner.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Website</b>
        <ul>

        <b>Name of journal</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As far as we know, the journal name (<%= setting(:name) %> (<%= setting(:abbreviation) %>)) is unique and not one that is easily confused with another journal or that might mislead potential authors and readers about the journalâ€™s origin or association with other journals.

      <div class="generic-content-item" id="costs">
        <h1>Cost and Sustainability Model</h1>
        <p><%= setting(:name) %> is an open access journal <em>committed to running at minimal costs, with zero publication fees (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_processing_charge">article processing charges</a>) or subscription fees</em>.</p>

        <p>Under the NumFOCUS nonprofit umbrella, <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> is now eligible to seek grants for sustaining its future. With an entirely volunteer team, <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> is seeking to sustain its operations via <%= link_to 'donations', "https://numfocus.org/donate-to-joss", target: "_blank" %> and grants, keeping its low cost of operation and free service for authors.</p>

        <p>In the spirit of transparency, below is an outline of our current running costs:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Annual Crossref <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/20pub_fees.html">membership</a>: $275 / year
          </li>
          <li>Annual Portico <a href="https://www.portico.org/join/how-publishers-can-join/">membership</a>: $250 / year
          </li>
          <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> paper DOIs: $1 / accepted paper</li>
          <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> website hosting (Heroku): $19 / month</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Assuming a publication rate of 200 papers per year this works out at ~$4.75 per paper ((19*12) + 200 + 275 + 250) / 200.</p>

        <p>A more detailed analysis of our running costs is available <a href="http://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/06/cost-models-for-running-an-online-open-journal" target="_blank">on our blog</a>.</p>

        <h4>Income</h4>

        <p>JOSS has an experimental collaboration with <%= link_to "AAS publishing", "https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2018/12/a-new-collaboration-with-aas-publishing" %> where authors submitting to one of the AAS journals can also publish a companion software paper in JOSS, thereby receiving a review of their software. For this service, JOSS receives a small donation from AAS publishing. In 2019, JOSS received $200 as a result of this collaboration.</p>

        <h4>Donate</h4>

        <p>Donations are one way for JOSS to offset our costs: <%= link_to image_tag("https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-to%20JOSS-brightgreen.svg"), "https://numfocus.org/donate-to-joss", target: "_blank" %></p>
