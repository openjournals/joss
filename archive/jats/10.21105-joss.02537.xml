  <title>Statement of Need</title>
  <p>Geographic open data is widely available today not only to
  researchers but to the general public. Globally operating
  organisations such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</ext-link>,
  and more localised portals such as the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/">Open
  Geography Portal</ext-link> and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/">Open
  Development Cambodia</ext-link> provide geographic data in a multitude
  of formats to download and analyse.</p>
  <p>There are a variety of tools available to suit users with different
  objectives, requirements and technical abilities, all of which have
  different advantages and disadvantages regarding their ease of use,
  interoperability, extensibility, licence, cost, and other factors.</p>
  <p>Technically inclined users can harness programming languages such
  as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org/">Python</ext-link>
  or
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</ext-link>
  to process and analyse their data and plot it using tools and
  libraries such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MatLab</ext-link>,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</ext-link>
  or geoplot
  (<xref alt="Bilogur, 2016" rid="ref-geoplot" ref-type="bibr">Bilogur,
  2016</xref>) and the Javascript-based library Leaflet
  (<xref alt="Agafonkin, 2010" rid="ref-leaflet" ref-type="bibr">Agafonkin,
  2010</xref>) has made the visualisation of geographic data more
  accessible to software developers outside the scientific
  community.</p>
  <p>Closed-source commercial desktop-based tools such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arcgis.com/index.html">ArcGIS</ext-link>
  are popular, but open-source alternatives such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</ext-link>
  and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://udig.refractions.net/">uDig</ext-link>
  exist. For paying subscribers, online services such as ArcGIS Online,
  and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://carto.com/pricing/">Carto</ext-link>
  are available. While free services such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://qgiscloud.com/">QGIS
  Cloud</ext-link> exist, private maps are typically premium features,
  which raises questions of data privacy. In order to securely share
  interactive maps with a small number of trusted users online while
  retaining control over the physical location of the data in accordance
  with data protection laws, users can publish their own maps using
  tools such as qgis2web
  (<xref alt="Chadwin et.al., 2015" rid="ref-qgis2web" ref-type="bibr">Chadwin
  et.al., 2015</xref>) to convert their maps to static web-based maps
  although “many elements cannot be reproduced”
  (<xref alt="Chadwin et.al., 2015" rid="ref-qgis2web" ref-type="bibr">Chadwin
  et.al., 2015</xref>) and a new static version has to be produced after
  each change to the original map.</p>
  <p>Statistical data can readily be obtained from places, such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</ext-link>,
  but it often relates to geographic locations using identifiers. While
  these are typically defined in publicly available datasets, they often
  come in formats such as CSV and need to be linked to the geographic
  data before the data can be visualised.</p>
  <p>Without the technical skills to perform preliminary data
  processing, cleaning, and mapping, or the money to commission such
  work, certain groups are left out:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Researchers from non-technical fields such as social sciences
      miss out on the benefits data visualisation can give them or lose
      time on manually processing large datasets.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Users and organisations with an interest in analysing their own
      data but without the budget to pay for professional software or
      services often have no other option than handing over their data
      to online services, but</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>in places where internet connectivity is bad (such as Lower-
      and Middle Income Countries), transferring large datasets is not
      always possible and</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>sensitive data, as used in medical-related fields, often comes
      with restrictions on how and where it can be stored, leaving users
      at the mercy of providers of such services and their data
      protection policies.</p>

  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>BigX addresses these issues as follows:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>By using an open-source license, it is freely available to
      anyone.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>All data processing is done client-side, which makes it easily
      configurable to work offline or semi-offline (using an online
      base-map but local data). This means that:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>no data ever leaves the machine, so it cannot be
          intercepted or otherwise leaked,</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>because data does not need to be transferred, response
          times are much faster (subject to the machine it runs on).</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>BigX can be deployed using simple access control measures such
      as .htaccess files and allows making updates to maps in a simple
      text editor, thus supporting environments where GUI access may not
      be present.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>The markup-like definition of layers does not require the user
      to have programming skills — a basic understanding of the data is
      sufficient to generate a data layer.
      <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="figU003Amap">Figure 1</xref> shows an
      example for a layer markup and the result. There are various layer
      types and options available to suit different types of data, all
      of which are explained in the
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/geekysquirrel/bigx/-/blob/dev/src/manual.md">manual</ext-link>.</p>

  <p>So far, BigX has been used to map population movements in China
  during the COVID-19 pandemic
  (<xref alt="Southampton, 2020" rid="ref-popmap" ref-type="bibr">Southampton,

  distances for prosthetics patients in Cambodia as part of a wider
