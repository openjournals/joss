<p>
  JOSS welcomes submissions from broadly diverse research areas. For this reason, we request that
  authors include in the paper some sentences that would explain the software functionality and
  domain of use to a non-specialist reader. Your submission should probably be somewhere between
  250-1000 words.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A list of the authors of the software and their affiliations</li>
  <li>A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience</li>
  <li>A clear statement of need that illustrates the purpose of the software</li>
  <li>A list of key references including a link to the software archive</li>
  <li>Mentions (if applicable) of any ongoing research projects using the software or recent scholarly publications enabled by it</li>
</ul>

<p>
  As this list shows JOSS papers are only permitted to contain a limited set of metadata (see
  header below), Summary &amp; Reference sections. You can see an example paper
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrn/gala/f6bb2532afeed3c0b0feea3037bf71a3f42b2a12/paper/paper.md" target="_blank">here</a>. Given this
  paper format it is <em>not</em>  permitted to write a "full length" paper i.e. one that includes
  software documentation such as API (Application Programming Interface) functionality, as this
  should instead be outlined in the software documentation.

# Summary

The forces on stars, galaxies, and dark matter under external gravitational
fields lead to the dynamical evolution of structures in the universe. The orbits
of these bodies are therefore key to understanding the formation, history, and
future state of galaxies. The field of "galactic dynamics," which aims to model
the gravitating components of galaxies to study their structure and evolution,
is now well-established, commonly taught, and frequently used in astronomy.
Aside from toy problems and demonstrations, the majority of problems require
efficient numerical tools, many of which require the same base code (e.g., for
performing numerical orbit integration).

``Gala`` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for ``Gala`` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. ``Gala`` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the ``Astropy`` package [@astropy] (``astropy.units`` and
``astropy.coordinates``).

``Gala`` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in ``Gala`` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike. The source code for ``Gala`` has been
archived to Zenodo with the linked DOI: [@zenodo]
